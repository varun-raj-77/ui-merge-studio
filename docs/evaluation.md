# Phase 0 evaluation

PASS requires visual component selection to lead through source identity, common-ancestor delta, symbol/hunk dependencies, bounded reconciliation, and verification to a functioning candidate that excludes unrelated edits. MODIFY applies when the claim remains plausible but a bounded contract or implementation must change. ABANDON applies when reliable separation cannot be achieved without manual file ownership, prepared patches, or metadata cheating.

Commit boundaries are not a valid feature-isolation signal. Both positive branches intentionally contain useful and unrelated behavior in one commit. Branch names, messages, documentation, generator details, verification expectations, and test metadata are forbidden production inputs. A result that can pass by cherry-picking or commit filtering fails.

This repository evaluates only fixture reproducibility, topology, behavior, and anti-cheating preconditions. It does not evaluate the future engine.
